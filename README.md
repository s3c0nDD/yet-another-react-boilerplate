# yet-another-react-boilerplate
This is my Boilerplate for React applications, based on project [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

After cloning do:
```
cd yet-another-react-boilerplate
yarn install
yarn start 
```

or `yarn build` in case you want to build app.

### Things added or integrated by me:
1. Sass instead of CSS
2. Bootstrap 3 + [React Boostrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io)
3. [React Router v4](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start)
4. Router and React Bootstrap integration: [react-router-bootstrap](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-router-bootstrap)
4. to be continued...
